THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS FIRST BEING THE MAKEFILE, I COULD NOT GET THE MAKEFILE TO WORK

ON THIS LAB I DID FEEL LIKE I LEARNED A LOT, HAHA OMG. I LEARED LOTS MORE ABOUT POINTERS

I AM GOING TO USE THIS LAB AS A LEARNIGN EXPERIENCE, I REALLY NEED TO WORK HARDER. THIS IS

I DID TRY AND USE GDB TO SEE IF I WAS DOING TO LINKED LIST CORRECTLY, I USED THINGS SUCH AS DISP NODE
TO SEE THE ADDRESS AND SEE IF IT POINTED IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION. I ALSO USED GDB TO SEE IF I WAS USING
POINTERS CORRECTLY, MORE SPECIFICALLY IF THINGS WERE POINTING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AS WELL AS TO SEE IF
THE VALUES WERE EXPECTED.
